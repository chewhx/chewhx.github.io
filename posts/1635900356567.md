List of things to learn:

```text
- blockchain development (web3, truffle, ganache, solidity)
- C# .NET API - to understand server code at work
- Advanced React - to optimise and build better React applications
- React Native - build mobile apps
- Puppeteer
- React Testing
- GitHub CLI
- GitHub Actions
```

List of things I'm working on, or, thinking of working on:

```text
- updating [one-listen](https://github.com/chewhx/project-one-listen)
- writing a cli for creating journal entries here
- adding topics to personal site on crypto, web dev
- building an application based on google cloud vision, to archive images
- adding useful code snippets or codepens to the site
- adding dark mode to this site
```

There are a lot of great tips here, on working with 11ty and Nunjucks: [https://dinhanhthi.com/11ty-nunjucks/#frontmatter](https://dinhanhthi.com/11ty-nunjucks/#frontmatter)

I'm pretty satisfied with the simple approach to my personal site now. It took me longer than I'd thought to find a style and design I like, after trying so many fancy UI experiments, I still prefer a black and white, minimal look. I think, at heart, I'm a modernist, but I try so hard to be postmodern. Lol.

After lunch thought: When you tell people you are learning coding as recreation, nobody seems to pay attention. But when you tell someone you found a job as a developer, by self-learning or self-taught, suddenly he or she is curious. Somehow, having a "job" in this society, still act as some sort of validation. Like a certificate or degree in the field of study.

In any case, I'd love to share how I got here. When I have time to write it up.

But for anyone who wants to learn programming. A grand tip: learn with a goal in mind, then it'll be easier to stay on track and push through difficulties when the going gets though.

I wanted to create and deploy a kickass web app, and I'd stop at nothing to continue learning.

Learning notes:

- Solidity has a few kinds of functions: private, public, pure, view, internal, and external
- All functions are public by default
- Functions can return multiple values, unlike regular javascript functions.
- **view functions** are only for viewing date from the app, and not modifying it
- **pure functions** don't access any values from the state of the app - like a multiply function
- **internal** is the same as private, except that it's also accessible to contracts that inherit from this contract. (Hey, that sounds like what we want here!).
- **external** is similar to public, except that these functions can ONLY be called outside the contract — they can't be called by other functions inside that contract. We'll talk about why you might want to use external vs public later.

- Ethereum has the hash function _keccak256_ built in, which is a version of SHA3. A hash function basically maps an input into a random 256-bit hexadecimal number. A slight change in the input will cause a large change in the hash.

- Smart contracts can have event listeners to _listen_ for certain events, and then take action. (Kind of like nodejs event listeners)
- Frontend applications can listen in on these events and take action.

- Progress of zombie smart contract up to Chapter 13:

```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract ZombieFactory {

    // declare our event here
    event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);
    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) private {
        uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1;
        // and fire it here
        emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }
}
```

- Source code for zombie lesson: [https://github.com/loomnetwork/cryptozombies-lesson-code](https://github.com/loomnetwork/cryptozombies-lesson-code)

- in Solidity, use _require_ function to compare and verify certain conditions. It does not have native string comparisons, so for strings we need to compare their _keccak256_ hash
- State variables (variables declared outside of functions) are by default storage and written permanently to the blockchain, while variables declared inside functions are memory and will disappear when the function call ends.
- Usually Solidity will handle the storage, **except when dealing with structs and arrays within functions**.

- Interacting with other contracts
  - Need to declare an interface which is a contract with functions you want to call, without curly braces:
  ```javascript
  contract NumberInterface {
  function getNum(address _myAddress) public view returns (uint);
  }
  ```
