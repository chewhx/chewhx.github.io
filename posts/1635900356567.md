List of things to learn:

- C# .NET API - to understand server code at work
- Advanced React - to optimise and build better React applications
- React Native - build mobile apps

```

List of things I'm working on, or, thinking of working on:

```
- updating [one-listen](https://github.com/chewhx/project-one-listen)
- writing a cli for creating journal entries here
- adding topics to personal site on crypto, web dev
- building an application based on google cloud vision, to archive images

There are a lot of great tips here, on working with 11ty and Nunjucks: [https://dinhanhthi.com/11ty-nunjucks/#frontmatter](https://dinhanhthi.com/11ty-nunjucks/#frontmatter)

I'm pretty satisfied with the simple approach to my personal site now. It took me longer than I'd thought to find a style and design I like, after trying so many fancy UI experiments, I still prefer a black and white, minimal look. I think, at heart, I'm a modernist, but I try so hard to be postmodern. Lol.

After lunch thought: When you tell people you are learning coding as recreation, nobody seems to pay attention. But when you tell someone you found a job as a developer, by self-learning or self-taught, suddenly he or she is curious. Somehow, having a "job" in this society, still act as some sort of validation. Like a certificate or degree in the field of study.

In any case, I'd love to share how I got here. When I have time to write it up.

But for anyone who wants to learn programming. A grand tip: learn with a goal in mind, then it'll be easier to stay on track and push through difficulties when the going gets though.

I wanted to create and deploy a kickass web app, and I'd stop at nothing to continue learning.
