This was something I discovered quite recently. I always thought you should be doing computer automation with python or bash scripts, given them many people use them for "processing" or "scripting". NodeJS may not have as great support for accessing the computer system, but there are great packages online to enhance its usability.

For one, I built a Node CLI to automate creating markdown journal entries with template.

Automating the deletion of files:

- set a main directory
- get a list of the sub directory
- set the conditions of the files you want to delete, most possibly by file names (I downloaded tutorial videos with many different languages of sub, and I want to delete all the non English ones, because my video player keeps autoplaying the non-English subs)
- loop through the sub directories, get the files in the sub directory, and loop thru the files to check if they should be deleted
- this only considers two levels of directory, but not when there are more nested directories
