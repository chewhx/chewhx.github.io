- "Serverless cloud function to buy crypto on monthly basis through API" should be good to go. I just need to take out some time to refine and make sure it's secure.
- Revisited [react-table](https://react-table.tanstack.com/) for work. It's so powerful, and customisable. No wrapped packages out there can compare to using the native react-table, because you can extend and customise for your own react components.
- Working on a concept which involves combining [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) and [faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) for mocking up data and a quick mock server, on a react project.
