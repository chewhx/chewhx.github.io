I built a local cli which create a template markdown file for each entry in this journal. I added for the command to open up the newly create file in vscode so I can write straightaway without having to navigate to the file manually. Was going to try to do it with shell script myself but went with using this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/open) which already implemented the solution.

I added a new command to list the journal entries, from which I can choose based on the title and open it up.
