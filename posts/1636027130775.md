- code deployed on the blockchain is immutable
- code is law
- if there is a flaw, you have to redeploy and have users use another contract address

- an external contract has a security hole where anyone can call the function
- we want to make an external contract _Ownable_ - which means it can be only executable by the assigned owner
- the Ownable contract is very common in most dapps and they usually extend from the Ownable class
- check out OpenZeppelin
- contract constructor()
- Function Modifiers: modifier onlyOwner()
  - half function used to modify other functions, usually to check some requirements prior to execution
- indexed keyword

- adding onlyOwner modifier to function

```javascript
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(isOwner());
    _;
  }
```

```javascript

  function setKittyContractAddress(address _address) external onlyOwner{
    kittyContract = KittyInterface(_address);
  }
```

I was supposed to log something, but I got distracted.

I managed to cook up a node cli which lets me create a new markdown file with front matter template, so I get write in this dev journal without much resistance.

```bash
# this creates new markdown file in ./posts
# there are options for title, tags, and other front matter too
npx journal new

# this deletes the latest markdown file created in ./posts
npx journal pop
```
