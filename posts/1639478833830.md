I finally made the switch to AWS from Google Cloud. The docs at google was abysmal. I'm surprised I made the switch now as I was spending more time searching for the code references on google than actually building the app. But google was easy to understand and use. I'm probably at the stage now I'm comfortable to use AWS, somewhat of what the people call Infrastruture as a service, compared to google where it's a Platform as a service

Nice style of writing git commit messages:

```
feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
fix: A bug fix
style: Feature and updates related to styling
refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
test: Everything related to testing
docs: Everything related to documentation
chore: Regular code maintenance.[ You can also use emojis to represent commit types]
```
