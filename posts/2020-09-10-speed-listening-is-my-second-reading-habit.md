## Second reading habit

The phenomenon is called ‚Äú[speed listening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_learning#Speed_listening)‚Äù. I was late to the game. The truth about listening to podcasts at 1x speed was that it quickly became boring and mentally dull. To listen carefully to every word and phrase spoken, fearing of missing out on details, it took me a few days to finish an hour or two long podcast episode. My thoughts on listening to audiobooks? Ridiculous. I would take less time overall to silent read a seven-hour long audiobook.

I was averaging between 15-25 books per year[^1], and I thought I could do better. Simply because I took short breaks in between bouts of successive reading and within those breaks, I fell prey to the pangs of idle infinite scrolling.

Then I chanced upon that [one simple habit which changed Ali Abdaal‚Äôs life](https://youtu.be/Fk3csAdegBI) as it did subsequently change mine too. He reframed the concept of listening to audio content (audiobooks, podcast, or audio articles) into two main benefits:

1. Consuming more stuff
2. Reducing time cost for consuming stuff

I read mainly non-fiction books. The pleasure derived not from the immersion of reading itself, but from the learning new skills and gaining new insights. Unlike reading fiction (my favourite ‚ÄòOne Hundred Years of Solitude‚Äô for instance), my relationship with non-fiction books can be termed as purely [transactional](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/the-rise-of-speed-listening/396740/). It was this book then the next, and I hardly re-read the same book except revisit the specific chapters.

‚ÄúSpeed listening‚Äù means listening to your audio content at higher playback speed. Anything above 1x and within your comfort zone. It also takes into account how fast the narrator is speaking as well, and for me, this is usually between 1.75x to 2x. An app I use, [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) uses machine learning to reduce intermittent silences, by smart boosting the playback speeds at certain parts of the audio.

I have since checked more books off my reading list and increased the rate of my learning per week.

Other than the benefits Ali shared, it made quite a few positive changes in my life:

- Pair speed listening to audio content with taking long walks and hikes. I take long walks as low-intensity exercise and to fill that aural idle time, I listen to audiobooks. Consequently, if I want to listen to audiobooks without being physically idle, I might as go for a walk.
- Fill my commute time with productive learning by speed listening to audio content. A city dweller spends an average of 1.5-2 hours commuting each day. Listening to audio content as 2x speed means that you can absorb between 3-4 hours of learning each day. The authors in [The Last Safe Investment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114117) termed this our ‚Äúunder-utilised aural capacity‚Äù.
- Learn topics and listen to books which were normally difficult to silent read because of the density of the material. i.e. philosophy, HBR guides
- Whenever my eyes tire from reading, I switch to listening to audio content, so I maximise my learning time.

Studies have shown that we can [read and listen to around 300 words per minute, while speaking at half that rate](https://medium.com/@kylecrocco/can-you-really-speed-listen-podcasts-science-explains-a078bdab76). So if you are afraid that you would lose comprehension of the material you are listening to by increasing playback speed (like I did) it just means that you need to acclimate yourself to speed condition. The key is to start incrementally increasing the playback speed until a comfort zone. Subsequently, challenge yourself to listen at much higher speeds and bring it down again. You will gradually acclimatise your comprehension by listening at high playback speeds. The next time you hear an audio clip narrated at 1x speed, you will feel like time has slowed.

Since there is [no impairment in learning by upgrading to speed listening](https://www.wired.com/2017/02/learn-faster-by-speeding-up/), we are diminishing the value of our time when we ‚Äúsavour‚Äù audio content at 1x speed. In some instances, boredom and lethargy creep in and we abandon the consistent habit of learning altogether.

For anyone who struggles to find time and space to read, and for those who would like to increase your rate of personal learning, I encourage you to give speed listening a try. You have nothing to lose. Except for five minutes of your time. And in that time you would have learnt ten minutes of stuff.

## A small tip - reduce your friction to listening

If you decide to adopt speed listening and you listen on Bluetooth earphones, I would leave you with a small tip to improve your overall experience: invest in a good pair of wireless earbuds which can reduce the friction between playing and pausing your audio content.[^2]

Before that, I was using a wired Jaybird Bluetooth earphones:

1. Remove earphones from case
2. Press and hold 3 seconds to switch on earphones
3. Pop earphones into my ears
4. Unlock phone and press play
5. When done, press pause
6. Press and hold for 5 seconds to switch off earphones[^3]
7. Remove earphones
8. Keep in case

In another [video](https://youtu.be/YUBm9fS54SU?t=02m47s), Ali Abdaal talked about this dream service or capability whereby if we could just snap our fingers and magically listen to any audio content which we wanted. It is not possible now, but presented an ideal we could strive for.

James Clear in Atomic Habits [talked of](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains) how the aggregate of marginal gains helped British Cycling climbed from no ranks to Olympic champions in five years. Minor changes or improvements, like painting the wall a new colour, having the athletes wash hands, changing pillows and mattresses, might seem inconsequential at first glance. But over time they build on each other and aggregate to far larger effects than what one could have predicted on initial first glances.

In my circumstance, while most people might already be satisfied with the current routine of listening, I strived to cut the eight steps to ideally no steps at all, coming as close to the ‚Äúsnap fingers listening capability‚Äù.

I invested in a set of true wireless earbud, which eliminated the redundant steps no. 2 and no. 6, shaving seconds off my routine. Furthermore, without those two steps, I could listen to my audio and pause, cutting the time between pausing and my next appointment as close as possible. When before, I had to plan ahead to pause, switch off, and keep my earphones.

Current routine with my wireless earbuds:

1. Remove earbuds from case
2. Pop them into my ears
3. Unlock phone and press play
4. When done, pause audio
5. Remove earbuds
6. Keep in case

The elimination of the two steps might not seem much, but statistically, it was a 25% improvement. It made the experience of listening, not just speed listening, much more seamless and enjoyable.

Alternatively, you can use plug-in wired earphones. üòÇ

[^1]: I read 21 books in 2019. I have read 34 books in 2020 so far, with four months left in the year. It‚Äôs not a contest of numbers, but the rate at which I gain new ideas and knowledge which feeds into improving my professional and personal life.
[^2]: I concede that listening on plug-in wired earphones will be much easier. Plug in. Play. Pause. Plug out. However, I do much of my listening when I move around or exercise, so I prefer the convenience of being cable-free. The industry and consumers are also trending towards wireless accessories in recent years. We are seeing 3.5mm headphone jacks disappearing from mobile devices. So if you need to buy new earphones, you can consider going wireless.
[^3]: I switch them off to conserve battery. It plays a sound notification when powering down, so I keep them in my ears. Or at least one side of it.
