I lost a few paragraphs I typed out earlier this afternoon. It was to test out the keychron keyboard I bought.
I finally gave up on the Apple magic keyboard. It offered one of the best typing experience except it wasn't versatile enough to allow connections to other devices and lacked a wired feature for when the bluetooth connectivity had issued and to avoid using batteries.

I'm surprised by how fast I can type on the new keychron, but also the amount of mistakes I made. There is less finger travel between each key.

Many of the mistakes I made:

- accidentally pressing two keys because they are packed quite close together
- missed out tapping on a key because mechanical keyboard requires a little bit more press
- mistyped words: "mistaek" is supposed to be "mistake"
- the area where the symbols are on the right of the keyboard is more packed - so I often hit the UP arrow, when I wanted to press SHIFT. Mixed up the period and comma. Pressing a lot of "////" and ":::::" when it's supposed to be the key next to them.

I hope I can adapt to the keyboard layout soon. The ergonomics is still alright for me because I got a palm rest. It's SUPER high for a keyboard, so I need something to prop up the hands, otherwise I will be bending my wrist to type. But if you sit rather tall and have your arms at a 90 degree angle, should be fine.
