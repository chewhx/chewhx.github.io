I wanna build a parser here to capture all the links I pasted and convert them to markdown syntax with the page title, so I don't have to manually copy paste the web page title and put all the links into proper format.

Instead of committing my changes, I'll set a npm script to **publish**

- the parser will scan new posts and replace all links with the markdown syntax,
- git add and commit
- git push

I can add anything else too, this publish workflow can format my posts and commit, without me having to do it manually all the time.
