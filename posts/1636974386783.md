In almost any type of study, work, or endeavors, you will encounter a form a slow down or "drag". It's when you make very little progress or feel unmotivated to do something, especially after having experienced several periods of highly productivity or motivation.

In almost everything I try to code, or problem solve, I'm turned away by a dread of having not achieve something significant or worthwhile. I recognise that this is normal, and is not really a form of burnout as my work and personal life are not so embroiled in busyness.

I hope I get back that form of inspiration and energy to continue coding something and make it good. Good enough to feed proud about publishing it and having advanced several steps ahead as a mature developer and programmer.

I really like writing code and creating applications. Solving problems and making myself learn new things to keep every day of my life fresh. In a way, I'm also becoming more nerdy?
