# 16:40:30

Been busy writing a new React project at work. I'm trying a new thing, which I hope will bring better workflow. Writing components in styled-components and using `routeConfig.js` to create react-router routes.

On another note, my serverless function for gemini api works on localhost but not on the cloud. Strange.

Serverless function failure update: I see the problem now. Because I'm making two api calls to the server in one function, my nonce (a unique identifier) were similar.

The nonce was set based on the current epoch time using `Date.now()`

I supposed on my localhost, my machine runs a little bit slower, so the two calls were successful because the of a time lag, but on google's server, there is minimal time lag, resulting in two similar nonce created â€” because the api calls were issued almost simultaneously.

I think I encountered this issue before, but I had forgotten about it.

I can't use uuids for the nonce because Gemini API requires them to be sequential - so I probably have to insert a manual time lag.
