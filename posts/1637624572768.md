Been having lag on my computer. Not sure if it's because I run iOS simulator. Yeah my comp is really old, but it works fine for my normal dev work in React and JS. Just that when it comes to more modern dev framework like react native and ios...

[Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/lessons/node-crypto-examples/) has more quality content that one would ever be able to finish learning or using.

Trying to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to build and document reusable components. It's somehow more complicated to use than it looks, because the docs are not as comprehensive. 
It was difficult to import fonts, and add sass.
Took me a while to find out that the app pulls description from propTypes.

Going to code my guess flag pop quiz game on react native. This is the ta-dah moment, because I have always envisioned it more of a mobile app thing, rather than a web app thing.
