new URL("https://github.com/chewhx?tab=repositories");

const takeScreenshot = async (url, fileName) => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    headless: true,
    timeout: 100000,
  });

  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto(url, {
    waitUntil: "networkidle2",

Creating the cloud function to buy crypto on gemini exchange, on dollar cost averaging, took longer than I expected. I was stuck on creating a dynamic email template to send myself as notification, each time the cloud function executed.

I tried handlebars package, but went back to ejs because it supports javascript to manipulate the templated values.

A rough flow of this cloud function should be like this:

1. On every 14th and 28th of the month
2. Get the current bid price of (coin/token)
3. Execute a immediate-or-cancel BUY order based on a regular amount of say, US$20.
4. Send myself and email notification for the order and available balances
5. If any errors, also send myself an email to notify so I can fix them.
6. It should be triggered by a http-request, bearing a unique param or query that "authenticates" this functions, otherwise anyone can trigger it.
7. I should include the coin or amount in the params/query, to avoid editing the function once it has been uploaded.
