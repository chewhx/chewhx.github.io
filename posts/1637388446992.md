The past few days, I got around to start working on learning react native as complimentary to my React web development skillset.

A couple of thoughts:
- It was difficult to get set up on the native development experience because my mac and OS is not new. Web development is easier to pick up with any kind of system you own, because the technologies are much more inclusive and open than mobile - iOS and Android.
- I'm glad [Expo Dev Tools](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) exist because I could still learn the development without having to run Xcode, which is a really heavy package for own old Mac.
- I have to gather more tools, packages, and workarounds under my belt for React Native development.
