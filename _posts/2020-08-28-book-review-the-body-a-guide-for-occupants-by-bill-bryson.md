As a species, we don’t care for our bodies enough until it fails us. We exemplify our mental capabilities to explain progress and success while shunning away from the biology which makes it possible in the first place. Even with digital technology today we still interface with our bodies. Faces and colour don’t tell us as much the person underneath, but body shapes and size lie less often about our constitution. Our bodies, like languages, are mediums we used to communicate. They fill the gaps between the meeting of minds.

In the year when a pandemic reign, it seems appropriate to renew one’s understanding and appreciation for our biochemistry. 

The book is organised into independent chapters. Chapters 12 and 20 elucidate on matters regarding the immune system and diseases respectively.

Bryson writes a mini-encyclopedia or wiki on our bodies which reads easy and relatable. He does not bother to bog the readers down with many backstories and medical facts, preferring to skip over to more interesting topics to keep us entertained.

There were anecdotes of early surgery not for the weak stomach. They highlighted dramatically, the progress we’ve made since, from early medical science and surgical innovation. Without the privilege of anaesthesia [(here's an interesting video about how anaesthetics work](https://youtu.be/B_tTymvDWXk) in the past, patients had to endure the pains of probe and incision, which left enduring physical and mental trauma.  

This is a recommended read for those who love non-fiction and read for the passion of knowledge. You will be entertained and for the geeks, there are comprehensive endnotes on the sources for one to explore further readings. (I’m not one of them)

But even for the general reader, you will gain a renewed appreciation for your bodily functions and understand why you should take better care of them. Our heart is an engine that never stops, while our immune system is the best coalition of armed forces out there, waging a never-ending war against the invading virus and harmful bacteria. Your sight contributes just as much to what you taste. You should fight with your jaws and not your fist, even though it is considered a “dirty” fight. We are more likely to die of mismatch diseases conjured by our lifestyle, rather than cancer or viral plague. Evolution and bipedalism are the true culprits of painful childbirth. 

I hope this read hits you like a sharp pain, then throbbed in your minds over the years.
