Working at a non-profit organisation presents its own unique set of challenges and constraints. We often don't have reliable income sources and access to ready capital, for acquiring additional resources on demand. Thankfully, we live in a connected world where digital resources, information, and knowledge are in abundance.

I compiled a list of free online resources that should assist NPOs. In almost all cases, you have to be a registered charity or [Institute of Public Character (IPC)](https://www.charities.gov.sg/setting-up-a-charity/Pages/About-Charities-And-IPCs.aspx "Institute of Public Character (IPC)") to take advantage of them at no fees.

## [Google Suite for NPO](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/ "Google Suite for Non-profit")
[Registered charities and IPCs](https://www.charities.gov.sg/setting-up-a-charity/Pages/About-Charities-And-IPCs.aspx "Registerd charitites and IPCs") receive basic [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com.sg/intl/en_sg/pricing.html "Google Suite") subscription at no fees or charges. Some features include 30GB cloud storage for each user, business email, system-wide admin user controls. In Singapore, you have to register an account with [TechSoup Singapore](https://www.techsoupsingapore.sg/ "TechSoup Singapore") (third-party verifier), then submit the necessary documents for verification to receive a code to activate the free subscription on Google.
