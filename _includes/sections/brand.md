I’m a junior frontend developer on an agile team, working on fintech solutions for the freelancers and self-employed.

Several hundred git commits ago, I was managing art programmes at a [non-profit](https://www.siongleng.com/) and studying for a degree in [accountancy](https://accountancy.smu.edu.sg/).

My personality type is [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [5w6](https://www.truity.com/enneagram/personality-type-5-investigator).

I workout in the gym, watch too many tutorial videos and Netflix. I write hobby projects and host them on AWS or Google Cloud.

I’m also a [hodler](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp) and learning about web3 and blockchain.
