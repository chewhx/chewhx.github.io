I'm a Junior Frontend Developer @ [Lyte Ventures](https://www.lyteventures.com/). I code mainly in NodeJS and React. My main interests are building solutions for productivity, fintech and lifestyle applications.

Several hundred git commits ago, I was managing programmes, budgets, and grant compliance at a [non-profit arts organisation](https://www.siongleng.com/). I also volunteered at the Institute of Mental Health and for [ZeroWasteSG](http://www.zerowastesg.com/).

I wont't fit your typical profile of a developer, because I studied accountancy for my [bachelor's](https://accountancy.smu.edu.sg/) and [diploma](https://www.tp.edu.sg/schools-and-courses/students/schools/bus/accountancy-finance.html). That was before I realised I wanted to work outside of the accounting field. Strangely, I never regretted studying it because the knowledge and skills were pretty relevant and useful in my life now.

I started with learning [web development](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) in Aug 2020.
